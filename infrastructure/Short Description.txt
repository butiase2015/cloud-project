This is setup meant to mimic most on-premise networks Architecture.In the sense that you have DMZ facing publicly and the other networsk are NATted or Using only private communications
With this diagram we can assume each spoke is an environment, and the hub is the DMZ.
each ENV connects directly to the DMZ seperately.What it means is that DEV has no way to commmunicate with PROD or with STAGING and vice versa
this helps protect internal resources.

NB: to make the terraform code reusable I had to make core resources group in a module folder  and  then call them from wherever I will need them.
The files in the module folder are not broken down properly and I would love to explain directly why is that.
